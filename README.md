# CODSOFT - PERSONAL PORTFFOLIO USING WEB DEVELOPMENT

I worked as a web development intern for a month in Codsoft (August - 2024).
During the internship, I learnt new technologies that are required for web development. 
I learnt about HTML,CSS and Java technologies.
I gained hans-on experience doing the interactive personal portfolio project that combines these technolgies.
